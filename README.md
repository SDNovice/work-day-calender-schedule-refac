# work-day-calender-schedule-refac
## Description
So this web application was designed to help busy people be able to organized their 
work day schedule. Likewise the common work hours of a 9-5 are displayed and depending
on your current time if the events are past present or future. When I was presented 
with this application it was lacking the current day as well as only had 3 of the hours
displayed. As a result I used a jQuery method of Day.js() to continuously pull our current
time as well assigned IDs to each hour and ran them through a for loop to pull any event
set in the given hour. Most if not all my code has been written with jQuery.
