# work-day-calender-schedule-refac
## Descripion
So this web application was designed to help busy people be able to organized their 
work day schedule. Likewise the common work hours of a 9-5 are displayed and depending
on your current time if the events are past present or future. When I was presented 
with this application it was lacking the current day as well as honly had 3 of the hours
displayed. As a result I used a jQuery method of Day.js() to continously pull our current
time as well assigned IDs to each hour and ran them through a for loop to pull any event
set in the given hour. Most if not all my code has been written with jQuery.

## Usage
To use this web application click a desired hour and enter an event into the textbox.
click the save button of the hour you put the event in and refresh the page and it 
should save to the screen. Past events should be gray, present red, and future green.
